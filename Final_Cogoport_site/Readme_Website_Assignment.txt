Things that I was unable to do at the moment



(1) When we scroll down the original website the nav bar turns into white color. I have tried :target but I was unable to do it.
(2) The girl video just below the nav-bar and rightside of the whats app number plays but it takes some time. I don't know why.
(3) Rest of the site I have made and I used the cogoport font file and named it as fonts.css for the same font style as website.
